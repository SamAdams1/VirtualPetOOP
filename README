1. **Initialization**: 
    - Initializes Pygame and sets up the screen.
    - Loads necessary images and sets up the game window.

2. **Game Loop**:
    - The main loop of the game where all interactions occur.
    - Manages events such as quitting the game or key presses.
    - Updates the display and maintains the game's frame rate.

3. **Rooms and Interactions**:
    - Defines different rooms such as Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, etc.
    - Manages interactions with the pet and updates its stats.
    - Handles random events that can occur during gameplay.

4. **Pet Class**:
    - Defines the Pet class representing the virtual pet.
    - Manages pet attributes such as name, color, and stats.

5. **GUI Components**:
